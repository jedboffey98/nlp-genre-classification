The files are named such that the second letter of their names correspond to their genre.
Some genres have been eliminated from the corpus because they aren't clearly either fiction
or nonfiction (B - editorial, D - religion, F - lore, G - letters, R - humor).

The remaining documents (324 documents) have been separated into the training set
(60% which is 194 documents), the development set (20% which is 65 documents),
and the test set (20% which is 65 documents) randomly.

Also note that the files have POS tags included, which should be seperated from
the tokens.
